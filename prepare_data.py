Every release ships its labels differently — `dmos.csv` here, a MATLAB
struct there, an xlsx, a text file of "score filename" lines, one label file
per reference. This script reads whichever one it finds and writes:

    path                       absolute path to the image
    original_subjective_score  the score exactly as the release gives it
    scaled_subjective_score    the same, min-maxed into [0, 1], higher = better
    dataset                    which dataset the row came from
    reference                  the pristine image this is a version of, or the
                               image itself for photographs with no reference,
                               prefixed with the dataset name
    distortion, level          the type and severity as the release records them
    group                      that type folded into one of eight distortion
                               groups

After this, `dataset.py` just reads a CSV. Everything that knows about the
quirks of a particular release lives here, and you can open the result in a
spreadsheet and see what you are training on.

Two quirks worth knowing, both handled here:

- Scores come on 1-5, 0-9 and 0-100 scales, so `scaled_subjective_score`
  normalizes each dataset separately. `original_subjective_score` keeps the
  number the release published, untouched, so it stays checkable.
- CSIQ's is a DMOS: higher means *worse*. It gets flipped, so the scaled
  column always means quality.

# repaired; `authentic` covers photographs nobody applied a distortion to.

# when a group-conditioned model behaves strangely is whether two datasets
